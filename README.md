# The Odin Project- Google Homepage project

## Project Goal: deconstruct the website to get familiar with dev tools and html elements and CSS stylings

### The live website can be found at: https://amishfakun.github.io/google-homepage/

This project was a good way to get acquainted with the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned the syntax on codecademy but 
seeing everything in action was helpful. 

Wittcode tutorial's on youtube was super helpful.
